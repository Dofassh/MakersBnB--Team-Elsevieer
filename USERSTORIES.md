# Makers BnB User Stories

MakersBnB specification
We would like a web application that allows users to list spaces they have available, and to hire spaces for the night.

# Headline specifications:

Any signed-up user can list a new space.\

Users can list multiple spaces.\

Users should be able to name their space,\ provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.

Users should be able to offer a range of dates\ where their space is available.

Any signed-up user can request to hire any space\
for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.

Nights for which a space has already been booked\
should not be available for users to book that space.

Until a user has confirmed a booking request,\ that space can still be booked for that night.
